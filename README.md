# StringTheory
A thing for turning strings into pictures

Ideally using Simulated Annealing, but we'll see if I can even get that far.

rn the biggest problem is we don't account for cycles in hoops with non-prime resolutions,
and we similarly don't account for duplicate strings (which we very much need to)
