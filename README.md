# StringTheory
A thing for turning strings into pictures

Ideally using Simulated Annealing, but we'll see if I can even get that far.

Next step: not regenerate all the strings from scratch every turn (only change the full table if the # of nodes changes.)
(if we weren't lazy we wouldn't even have to regenerate the whole table from scratch but meh.)

Each string is identified by its source node (always less than its destination node), its destination node, and type

|`type`|corresponding string|
|---:|-|
|1| "right" outer tangent|
|2| "left" outer tangent|
|3| "right" inner tangent|
|4| "left" inner tangent|
